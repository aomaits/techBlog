# techBlog

## Description

This tech blog was created to allow users to create a profile and create their own blog content, or comment on the content of others. This project used CSS for the styling and handlebars as a templating language. The SQL database was scaffolded and seeded using MySQL and Sequelize. 

While the project ultimately remains incomplete, the objective of building my first full-stack application was achieved. This project also helped to add some understanding to the size and scope of the file structure of even a small project. It served as a practical introduction to MVC architecture and the templating of Handlebars was utilized to introduce concepts that later become useful in front-end component-driven libraries like React. 

## Project Completion
This project remains incomplete. Users are unable to delete their own profile once created. The user dashboard was not fully built out. Very minimal styling was completed on the project. 

The application was originally deployed via Heroku but it is no longer hosted there. 

## Future Development
Future development for this project is unlikely. Rather than refactoring this project, it might better serve as inspiration for a new build using different technologies.
